Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

I am currently studying at college in Vietnam and want to learn Machine Learning and related specialization as Deep Leaning. And I know that one of the most powerful technique to work on this area is Neural Network which really excites me. I think it will be beneficial for my researching work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I am student and I don't have any special source of income. The tuition fee is also covered thanks to my parents's help. My budget is just barely enough to meet basic human needs. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such a large amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I truly desire to delve into Machine Learning.

How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

Firstly, these courses about NN provide essential knowledge for me to finish my graduation thesis. And following that, it will boost my job prospects as some of the most sought-after skills in ML I acquired from it could surely highlight my resume. A scholarship would help me achieve my career goals in the next five years by reducing my stress over the lack of money and giving me the opportunity to focus on a well-rounded college experience. It will help me perform better in carrying out Machine Learning and give me an edge over my competitors. 
I plan to complete all assignments on or before due time as I have done in previous Machine Learning Course. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely like other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
