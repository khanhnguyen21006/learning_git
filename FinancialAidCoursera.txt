Why are you applying for Financial Aid?
I am currently studying at college in Vietnam and want to learn Machine Learning and related specialization as Deep Leaning. And I know that one of the most powerful technique to work on this area is Neural Network which really excites me. I think it will be beneficial for my researching work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. I am student and I don't have any special source of income I was in governmental university which means that I had a free education in my country. My budget is just barely enough to meet basic human needs.  In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such a large amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.  So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.
I want to take this course as I truly desire to delve into Machine Learning.

How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?
Firstly, I want to finish my thesis for graduation. And following that, this Course will boost my job prospects after graduating from my college. A scholarship would help me achieve my career goals in the next five years by reducing my stress over the lack of money and giving me the opportunity to focus on a well-rounded college experience. It will help perform better in carrying out Machine Learning and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.
I plan to complete all assignments on or before due time as I have done in previous  Machine Learning Course. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
