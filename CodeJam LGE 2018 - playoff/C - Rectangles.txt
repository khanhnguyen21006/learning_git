Description
Alex found N sticks that he played with when he was little. Sticks’ lengths are A1, A2, …, AN, and the length is an integer that is greater than or equal to 2.

Alex wants to create rectangles using these sticks. Each stick can be used at most once, and he cannot use multiple sticks to form a side of the rectangle. Not all sticks need to be used. Alex can make more than one rectangle. 

Alex also has a machine that can reduce the length of a stick by 1. If the original length of a stick was Ai, then it can be reduced to Ai-1 using this machine. Alex can use the machine as many times as he wants to, but he cannot reduce the length of the same stick more than once. 

Alex wants to make rectangles using these N sticks such that the sum of areas of the rectangles is maximized. You must compute this maximum area he can achieve.

Input
The first line contains N (1 = N = 10,000), the number of sticks.

The second line contains N integers describing the lengths of N sticks, A1, A2, ..., AN (2 = Ai = 100,000).

Output
Output the maximum total area of rectangles Alex can achieve.

Using the last four sticks (after reducing one 6-length stick’s length by 1), Alex can make a rectangle whose area is 5x6 = 30. Then, using the other four sticks of lengths 3, 4, 4, and 4, he can make another rectangle whose area is 3x4 = 12. There is no way to make rectangles whose sum of area is greater than 42.
