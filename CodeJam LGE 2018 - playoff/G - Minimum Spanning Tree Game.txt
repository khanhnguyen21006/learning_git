Description
Consider a simple graph G that contains N vertices and M undirected edges. A simple graph requires that no self-loops exist and at most one edge exists between any pair of vertices. A spanning tree of this simple graph is a set of edges that satisfy the following conditions.

1. The set contains N-1 edges.
2. Given two arbitrary vertices, there must be a path between the two vertices only using the edges in this set.
Among spanning trees, a minimum spanning tree (MST) is a spanning tree whose sum of weights of edges is smallest. 

We want to play the MST Game on a graph. 

- In this game, we need to compute the cost of an MST as we remove edges one by one. The cost of an MST is the sum of weights of the edges in the MST. Each turn’s score is equal to the cost of an MST found during that turn.
- The game is played for K turns, and in the first turn, we must compute the cost of MST of the given graph.
- At the end of each turn, we must remove the cheapest edge in the MST that we found during that turn. 
- Once an edge is removed, it cannot be used again in subsequent turns.
- If an MST does not exist, the score for that turn is 0. For all subsequent turns, the score remains to be 0 as well. It is possible that no MST exists even in the first turn.
Given a simple graph (with undirected edges) and K, compute the score for each turn when this game is played.

In this case, the MST found in the first turn contains five edges { (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 6), (4, 5) } whose cost is 16. After we remove the edge (2, 4), we find that no MST exists in the second turn. Hence the score is 0 for turn 2 and after.

Input
The first line contains the number of vertices N, the number of edges M, and the number of turns K (2 = N = 1,000, 1 = M = min(10,000, N×(N-1)/2), 1 < K = 100).

The following M lines describe M edges. Each line contains two vertices x and y. The same edge is given at most once. These M edges’ costs are 1, 2, …, M in the input order.

The vertices are labeled from 1 to N.

Output
You must output K numbers corresponding to the scores of K turns in a single line.
