Description
It’s Jaehyun’s birthday today. Jaehyun got N roll cakes from N friends, one from each friend. Each roll cake’s length is A1, A2, …, AN. Jaehyun only eats roll cakes of length exactly 10. Therefore, he wants to create as many roll cakes of length 10 as possible by cutting those N roll cakes. 

A roll cake can be cut into smaller ones, according to the following procedure.

First, pick a roll cake to be cut -- its length must be greater than 1. Let x be the length of the chosen roll cake.
Then, pick an integer y that is greater than 0 and less than x.
The roll cake is cut into two smaller ones of length y and x-y, respectively.
Jaehyun can cut roll cakes at most M times.  Compute the maximum number of roll cakes of length 10 that he can get. 

Input
The first line contains N, the number of roll cakes, and M, the maximum number of cuts Jaehyun can perform using the machine (1 = N, M = 1,000).

The second line contains N integers A1, A2, ..., AN (1 = Ai = 1,000) where Ai describes the length of an i-th roll cake.

Output
Output the maximum number of roll cakes of length 10 that Jaehyun can make.
